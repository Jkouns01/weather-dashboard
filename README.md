# weather-dashboard
 <h1> Acceptance Criteria</h1>
 <p>GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
 <br>
WHEN I search for a city
 <br>
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
 <br>
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
 <br>
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
 <br>
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city</p>

<h2> So what did I learn? </h2>
<p> In this assignment I had some issues but throughly enjoyed this project because it is acually apllicable to my day to day use!
 <br>
 I was able to succesfully use a 3rd party api that gathers weather data which you can then access. I also used some google fonts to change up the header. 
 I like the little weather icons as well which were pulled from the open weather source.
  <br> 
 I did not get to add in the 5 day weather portion and hope to do so here in the future. 

 I alo Tried to add a Thank you note to pop up after you entered a city but that did not work like I hoped so it is added into the weather content.
